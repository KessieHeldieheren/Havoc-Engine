# Havoc Engine
Havoc Engine is a PHP-based game engine designed to run 2D games in the command-line.

This project exists purely as a demonstration of building unorthodox applications using PHP. The project is built using [PHP 7.2](http://php.net/releases/7_2_0.php). Some may find the existence of this library offensive. It's all right, I find it offensive as well.

**Version**: 0.0.0-alpha

## Pre-word
This documentation uses [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) to define the terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT. Such as one SHOULD NOT build a game engine using PHP. But not to say one cannot.

Should you begin to experience a tingling sensation  around the front of your head, and you have an overwhelming urge to use `strlen` to hash functions, think that variables ought to be prefixed with `$`, or that [YODA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions) conditionals look attractive in ways one wouldn't talk about in public, please make an appointment with your general practitioner.

## <a name="S1">Instantiating the Engine</a>
The game engine core can be instantiated via the [API](#Api).  The API contains various helper functions for accessing engine modules, as well as a method for rendering output ([`Api::render`](#Api_render)).

**Important**
The game core will not be usable immediately. The core must then be bootstrapped using [`Api::bootstrap`](#Api_bootstrap). This will then load all controllers (how to extend the engine's controllers and modules is explained in [Extending the Engine](#S2)).
